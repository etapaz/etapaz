<h2>Papas Fritas - Ella me pide mas</h2>
<b>What inspired you to write Papas Fritas?</b><br>
I was playing on the floor with my daughter, and said "if we invented a funny song?".<br>
I'm Belgian, land of french fries, so the theme was quickly found.<br>
Who doesn't enjoy a good french fry?
<br>We started singing. 
<br><br>
<b>Was writing it in response to something significant that happened in your life?</b><br>
My business was heavily impacted by the COVID pandemic.<br>
I had more free time to think about and occupy myself with other things. <br>
In this case another more benign virus. The music one came back to me very quickly. 
<br><br>

<b>Where were you when you wrote and recorded it?</b><br>
At home, the idea really started on the ground, on the same floor, then I got up and called 2 musician contacts, the first one for the instrumental part and the second one for the lyrics and the melody. Then a third one for the mix and mastering and it was done. 
<br><br>
<b>What are the ideas behind -Ella me pide mas-?</b><br>
To have fun above all, to have fun to entertain the public in return, to have a good time. To escape for a moment from everyday life to live a surprising adventure. 
<br><br>

<b>What's the connection between your instruments, bandmates, and collaborators?</b><br>
To tell you the truth, my music is made possible by the magic of today's connected world, I know very little about these collaborators who live thousands of miles away from me, but I can quickly identify if we are on the same page.
