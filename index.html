<h1>Etapaz is an independent, modern jazz artist based out of Chile in South America.</h1>
<h2>He blends together the classic sounds of World, Latin, and Jazz with a hint of Electronic Dance and contemporary production.</h2>
<h2>The result of this unlikely combination is a unique, signature sound that is entirely his own. Providing listeners with rich, worldly soundscapes, catchy rhythms and exotic melodies.</h2>
<p>Etapaz is a modern jazz artist that combines the classic sensibilities of jazz music with the shimmering glisten and styles of modern production.</p>
<p>He has just completed his first album, an impressive collection of four tracks which pushes the genre in exciting, innovative directions. The release showcases Etapaz&rsquo;s signature ability to seamlessly blend together his favorite styles of Latin, World, and Jazz with a hint of electronic dance music.</p>
<p>Much of Etapaz&rsquo;s art is hugely inspired by the exotic coastlines and epic landscapes in his current home of Chile. As well as, the ethnic roots of various cultures, with his current work being performed by a Brazilian Pianist and Italian Percussionist.</p>
<p>All in all, this unique combination of influences creates a soundscape of no other. With a realistic, worldly atmosphere and heart-felt rhythmic feel, that&rsquo;s grounded in a strong foundation of Latin-style jazz.<br />His compositions are meticulously structured, yet mystifying and take influences from artists like Tingvall Trio, Gogo Penguin, Avishai Cohen and Dave Brubeck.</p>
<p>The budding musician and composer was raised on a steady diet of rock, pop, and folk music by his parents who were hippies throughout the 1970s. His interest in music continued into college where he took up guitar, however it wasn&rsquo;t until recently as an adult, that he began seriously investing into his art.</p>
<p>The colorful and expressive feel that overlays much of Etapaz&rsquo;s work, comes from his deep love of Latin culture that he developed after backpacking across South America as a teenager.<br />Finally settling in Chile at the age of 40, he now works out of his own office that overlooks the Pacific Ocean and The Aconcagua (the highest mountain in South America).</p>
<p>The scenery and culture act as a constant inspiration for Etapaz&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Working in digital marketing and being no stranger to modern technology, he began the composition and production of his musical ideas recently after collaborating with like-minded artists over the internet.</p>
<p>Utilizing modern music production techniques allows Etapaz to work with an exotic variety of different musicians and create something classic, yet unique that can stand its ground in the modern music market.</p>
